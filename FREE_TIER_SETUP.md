# Free Tier Setup Guide - No Paid APIs Required!

## The Reality Check

After testing, here's what's **actually free**:

| Data Source | What You Get | Cost | Status |
|-------------|--------------|------|--------|
| **SEC EDGAR** | ✅ Insider trading (Form 4) | FREE | ✅ Working! |
| **FMP Free** | ❌ No institutional data | FREE | ⚠️ Limited |
| **Twitter** | ❌ No search access | $100/mo | ❌ Too expensive |

## What Works for Free

### ✅ SEC EDGAR (Completely Free)

**What you get:**
- Form 4 filings (insider trading)
- Form 13F filings (institutional holdings) - but harder to parse
- All official SEC filings
- No API key needed!

**Setup:**
```env
# config/.env
SEC_USER_AGENT=Your Name your@email.com
```

**Test it:**
```bash
Sent\Scripts\activate
python src/data_sources/sec_edgar_collector.py
```

You should see:
```
Found 10 Form 4 filings:
Filing 1: Date: 2025-10-17, Type: 4, Insider trading...
```

### ⚠️ FMP Free Tier - What's Actually Available

**What FMP free tier includes:**
- Company profiles
- Stock prices (delayed)
- Financial statements
- Stock news
- Analyst ratings

**What FMP free tier does NOT include:**
- ❌ Institutional holdings ($149/month)
- ❌ Insider trading ($59/month)
- ❌ Mutual fund holdings ($149/month)

So the FMP institutional/insider modules **won't work** on free tier. You'd need:
- **Premium** ($59/mo) for insider trading
- **Ultimate** ($149/mo) for institutional holdings

## Recommended Free Setup

Since institutional data requires paid FMP, here's the best **completely free** setup:

### Option 1: SEC EDGAR Only (100% Free)

```bash
# Run analysis with just SEC data
python src/main.py --ticker AAPL --no-twitter
```

**What you'll get:**
- ✅ SEC Form 4 insider trading filings
- ✅ Insider activity analysis
- ✅ Filing frequency tracking

**What you won't get:**
- ❌ Social media sentiment (Twitter = $100/mo)
- ❌ Detailed institutional holdings (FMP = $149/mo)

### Option 2: Add Stock Price Data (Free)

FMP's free tier DOES include basic stock data. Let me create a module for that:

**Available for free:**
- Current stock price
- Historical prices
- Company profile
- Basic financials

## Testing Your Free Setup

### Test 1: SEC EDGAR (Should Work)

```bash
Sent\Scripts\activate
python src/data_sources/sec_edgar_collector.py
```

Expected: ✅ You'll see Form 4 filings

### Test 2: FMP Institutional Data (Won't Work on Free)

```bash
python src/data_sources/fmp_collector.py
```

Expected: ❌ 403 Forbidden errors (needs paid plan)

### Test 3: Run Full Analysis

```bash
python src/main.py --ticker AAPL --no-twitter
```

This will:
- ✅ Collect SEC Form 4 filings
- ❌ Skip Twitter (requires $100/mo)
- ❌ Skip FMP institutional (requires $149/mo)

## Alternative Free Data Sources

Since FMP institutional data costs money, here are true free alternatives:

### 1. Yahoo Finance (Free)

We could add a module for:
- Stock prices (free)
- Historical data (free)
- Basic company info (free)

**Not included:**
- Detailed institutional holdings
- But does show top institutional holders!

### 2. Alpha Vantage (Free Tier)

- 25 API calls per day (very limited)
- Stock prices
- Technical indicators

### 3. Polygon.io (Free Tier)

- Stock prices
- Some market data
- Limited to 5 API calls/minute

### 4. Reddit (Free)

- Could scrape r/wallstreetbets
- r/stocks, r/investing
- Free API, no limits
- Better sentiment than Twitter anyway!

## What Should We Do?

### Immediate Options:

**1. Use What Works (SEC EDGAR)**
```bash
python src/main.py --ticker AAPL --no-twitter
```
- You get insider trading data
- Completely free
- No API keys needed (except email)

**2. Add Yahoo Finance Module**
- I can create a Yahoo Finance collector
- Gets stock prices + top institutional holders
- Completely free, no API key
- Works well

**3. Add Reddit Sentiment**
- Free Reddit API
- r/wallstreetbets has good stock sentiment
- More signal than Twitter
- No cost

### Long-Term Options:

**If you want institutional data:**
- Pay for FMP Ultimate ($149/mo)
- Or parse SEC 13F filings manually (complex)

**If you want social sentiment:**
- Add Reddit (free) - better than Twitter
- Or pay for Twitter Basic ($100/mo)

## My Recommendation

Let me create a **Yahoo Finance collector** for you. It will add:

✅ Stock prices (real-time-ish)
✅ Top institutional holders (5-10 biggest)
✅ Basic company data
✅ Completely FREE
✅ No API key needed

This gives you:
1. **SEC EDGAR** - Insider trading (free)
2. **Yahoo Finance** - Stock prices + top holders (free)
3. **Skip Twitter** - Too expensive
4. **Skip FMP** - Institutional data costs $149/mo

Would you like me to:
- **A)** Create a Yahoo Finance collector (free, no API key)
- **B)** Create a Reddit sentiment collector (free, simple API key)
- **C)** Just use SEC EDGAR as-is
- **D)** Pay for FMP Premium/Ultimate

## Current State

Right now your app can:
- ✅ Analyze sentiment (TextBlob + VADER)
- ✅ Track insider trading (SEC EDGAR - free)
- ❌ Track institutional holdings (needs paid FMP)
- ❌ Social media sentiment (Twitter too expensive)

## Quick Test - What Actually Works

```bash
# This WILL work (free):
python src/data_sources/sec_edgar_collector.py

# This won't work on free FMP:
python src/data_sources/fmp_collector.py
# (You'll see 403 errors)

# This will work but skip unavailable sources:
python src/main.py --ticker AAPL --no-twitter
# (Only SEC data will show)
```

---

**Bottom Line:** FMP's free tier doesn't include the institutional data we wanted. We have two choices:
1. Add Yahoo Finance module (free, gets stock prices + top holders)
2. Pay for FMP Premium ($59/mo) or Ultimate ($149/mo)

Which would you prefer?
